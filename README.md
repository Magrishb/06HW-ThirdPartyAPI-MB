    <!-- I was doing really well and came to a wall. I asked the class on discord and was helped. The only problem is that their code was 60-80 lines long. When they explained their way and the reason why they used and did what they did, EVERYTHING CLICKED! I was happy and then dissapointed. I had just written ALOT of code and i was heartbreaking to delete what I've done. So I am just goin to turn in what I have gotten as far as I can. I was completly stuck on my javascript page.  I will clear my html and start anew. A better way that I can understand.-->
